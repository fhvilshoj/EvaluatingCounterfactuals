# On Quantitative Evaluations of Counterfactuals

## Install
To install required packages with conda, run the following command:

```bash 
> conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

## Code
The code contains all the evaluation metrics used in the paper as well as the models and the data.

To evaluate methods, you need to choose a config from the `configs` directory and to choose which metric to apply.
The code will then evaluate the chosen metrics on counterfactuals from all three methods (GB, GL, GEN) and store
the results in an appropriate subdirectory in `outputs`.
If you, e.g., want to run all metrics on the MNIST dataset, use the following command:

```bash
(cfeval) > python main.py --eval -c configs/mnist/mnist.ini -a
```

Afterwards you can enumerate the `directory` by
```bash
(cfeval) > python main.py --list
```
to get an output like the following:
```
> Listing dirs
000: ./output/celeba_makeup_[0]
001: ./output/fake_mnist_[0]
002: ./output/mnist_0_1_[0]
003: ./output/mnist_[0]
```

Now, results can be printed for the MNIST dataset (idx 3 above) by
```bash
(cfeval) > python main.py --print -c 3 
```
To get a result like
```
